The whole project was made by tonyshaw,buaa. To use this program, you need to have a test fil. The file should be formated as number1 number2 number3... this is an example:
D:\text.txt:  1 2 3 4 5 6
In CMD: homework01.exe D:\test.txt
output should be 21
The program will print the maxi-sum of a subsequeen. If the file is empty or can not be read, the program will print -9E18.
